# Spring - BeanFactory [â†‘](../../../README.md#spring-framework)
- Spring is a container and behaves like a factory of Beans.
- **Beans** are Java objects that are configured at runtime by Spring IoC Container.
- BeanFactory represents a basic IoC Container which is a parent interface of **ApplicationContext**.
- **BeanFactory** does not support Annotation-based configuration whereas **ApplicationContext** does.
